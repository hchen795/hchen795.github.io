I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Professor [Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2022.

I am broadly interested in machine learning for sequential data, with a focus on time series analysis, forecasting, and generative modeling. My current research explores probabilistic modeling and diffusion models for applications involving time series and neuroimaging data, such as EEG analysis, sleep studies, and 3D MRI brain volume generation. I am also interested in representation learning and scalable deep learning methods for structured temporal data.

In my spare time, I enjoy swimming and spending time with my dog.
